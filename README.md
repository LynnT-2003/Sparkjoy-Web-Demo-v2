# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript Starter

This is a starter template for building a type-safe React application using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. It leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, the flexibility of Tailwind CSS for styling, and the robustness of TypeScript for type-checking and ensuring code quality.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Provides server-side rendering, API routes, and routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building modern and responsive designs.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
